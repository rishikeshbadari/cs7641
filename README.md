# Project Repository

This repository contains all the files and directories used in our data modeling project. Each component plays a specific role in the process from data preprocessing to model visualization.

## Directories

- `/Datasets`: Contains the data sets used for model training and testing.
- `/Figures`: Includes generated figures such as graphs, plots, and visual representations of data and models.
- `/github_pages`: Houses files used to create and maintain the project's GitHub Pages site.
- `/preprocessing`: Contains scripts and notebooks for data cleaning and preparation before model training.

## Files

- `.DS_Store`: A hidden file that stores custom attributes of its containing folder, such as the position of icons or the choice of a background image (created by macOS systems).
- `/ML_Visualizations.html`: A HTML file presenting visualizations of the machine learning models.
- `/Modeling.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing the machine learning models, their training, evaluation, and results.
- `/README.md`: This file, describing the purpose and contents of the repository.
- `/gantt1.png`: An image file of the first version of the project's Gantt chart.
- `/gantt2.png`: An updated version of the Gantt chart reflecting the current project timeline.
- `/index.html`: The main HTML file for the project's GitHub Pages website.
- `/midterm_checkpoint.html`: A HTML file that provides a checkpoint update of the project at midterm.
- `/project_proposal.html`: A HTML file containing the project proposal as initially submitted.

Please note that updates to models and visualizations can be found within respective files with time stamps indicating the latest changes.

For any additional information on the project structure or specific files, please refer to the detailed comments within each file or contact the repository maintainers.
